sw-nginx is a **custom Nginx package provided by Plesk** for use with its control panel, designed to enhance web server performance and compatibility.  It supports dynamic modules and additional features like Brotli compression and PageSpeed through third-party repositories such as GetPageSpeed. This allows administrators to extend functionality without replacing the core Plesk-managed Nginx installation. 

## Prerequisites
- A server running a **RHEL-based OS** (e.g., CentOS, AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux)
- **Plesk control panel installed**
- Root or sudo access
- Internet connection to access repositories
